# Continued logarithm arithmetic

`clarith` is a Rust crate that provides primitives for basic arithmetic
with numbers expressed in a continued logarithm representation.

[Continued logarithm](https://perl.plover.com/classes/cftalk/INFO/gosper.txt) is a way of representing rational numbers with unbounded precision.
